# Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) - Q4 Refresh Project

This repository contains the Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) analysis for the Q4 2024 marketing activities. Using Meta's Robyn tool, we optimized ad spend allocation across various marketing channels to maximize ROI, focusing on advanced quarterly refresh tuning.

## Project Overview

### Notebooks Included
1. **MMM Analysis.ipynb**:
   - This notebook provides a detailed analysis of Marketing Mix Modeling using advanced machine learning techniques.
   - We utilized Bayesian regression, adstock models, and saturation curves to understand the impact of each marketing channel on overall sales.
   - The results were used to determine the optimal allocation of marketing spend for the best performance.

2. **Q4 2024 Yeppon Refresh.ipynb**:
   - Focused on the quarterly refresh of the MMM model specifically for Q4 2024.
   - Leveraged updated market data and recent campaign results to fine-tune the MMM model, providing fresh insights into ad efficiency.
   - Optimized budget allocation, ensuring maximum return on investment during the high-traffic Q4 period.

## Key Techniques and Tools
- **Meta's Robyn**: An open-source tool used for robust Marketing Mix Modeling.
- **Bayesian Regression**: Applied to improve model stability and estimate the incremental impact of marketing activities.
- **Adstock Effect**: Used to capture the carryover effect of marketing activities over time.
- **Saturation Curves**: Helped identify the point of diminishing returns for each marketing channel.
